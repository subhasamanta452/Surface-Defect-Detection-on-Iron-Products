# Surface-Defect-Detection-on-Iron-Products
Developed a computer vision model to classify defects in iron surfaces using CNNs (MobileNet, VGG16, ResNet50) with a limited dataset. Implemented data augmentation and GAN-based oversampling to address imbalances and improve accuracy. Integrated out-of-distribution detection to handle unseen samples effectively, enhancing model robustness and performance.
